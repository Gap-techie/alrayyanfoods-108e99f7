The following images would be needed for the website:

1. rice-field.jpg - A beautiful landscape of rice fields, preferably in Pakistan
2. classic-basmati.jpg - Image of classic basmati rice grains or packaged product
3. royal-basmati.jpg - Image of premium royal basmati rice
4. brown-basmati.jpg - Image of brown basmati rice
5. sella-basmati.jpg - Image of parboiled sella basmati rice
6. rice-plantation.jpg - Image of traditional rice farming
7. og-image.jpg - Featured image for social media sharing

For now, we're using placeholder references in the code. In a production environment, 
these would be replaced with actual optimized images.
